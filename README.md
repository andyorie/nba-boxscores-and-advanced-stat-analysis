# nba-boxscores-and-advanced-stat-analysis
<p> Project Goal: Illustrate my python skills in data processing, feature engineering and transformation, towards the preparation and output of a master file containing all NBA player boxscores and advanced stats between 2003 and 2022. 

Credit to the following account for scraping the raw data: https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/nba_games

The project objectives are as follows:
1. Create python notebooks (using Jupyter) and ancillary scripts (using the 'VS Code' IDE) to fulfill the data processing lifecycle. This is done by:
1.a Perform data collection by downloading pre-scraped data on github (see creditied account above).
1.b Merge / Join the individual raw data files to ensure appropriate features are available.
1.c Clean and feature engineering on the data to remove unwanted observations, type converstion errors (e.g. date objects to datetime), dealing with missing data, etc.
1.d Perform transformation to calculate new summaries statistics such as Usage Rate (USG%), Effective FG (eFG%), etc.
1.e Output the tidied file in excel and csv formats for future ML and EDA.

2. Create python notebooks to perform ML on the master file. 

Note. EDA will be performed using the Tableau BI tool. This analysis will be available via my public profile here:
